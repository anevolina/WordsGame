# WordsGame

Initially, it was a popular City Game, where a payer should input a name of a city which begins from the last letter of the previous city.

V 1.0 - play in console, Russian cities only (and Russian language)

Now I continue to improve it and work on implementing this game as a Telegram bot, translate it to English, and give a player possibility to choose the type of the words - animals, cities, countries, etc.
