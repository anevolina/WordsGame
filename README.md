# WordsGame

Initially, it was a popular City Game, where a payer should input the name of a city which begins from the last letter of the previous city.

V 2.0 (master) - it's a working telegram bot at @WordsGameAnaBot - two languages, two themes - cities and animals for both languages
______

V 1.1 - still play in the console. Realized possibility to choose the type of words - animals or cities, and switch to English... However, dictionaries have to be reconsidered...

Now I continue to improve it and work on implementing this game as a Telegram bot and translating it using gettext pack.
______

V 1.0 - play in console, Russian cities only (and Russian language)
